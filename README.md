# Machine-Learning in R and Python
During my studies at UTDallas, I have done lot of ML projects for clear understanding on the algorithm implementation. The repository includes all the R and python files with explanations for the code.

### Requirments
- Each script has its own requirments, which can be found at the top of the script for example the packages that are imported. In general
  - Python 3.8
  - R studio
  - The datasets are publicly available at UCI machine learning site and Kaggle
### Usage 
- From_Scratch_Linear_regression: I have done Python coding for linear regression without implementing any ML packages. It follows matrix multiplication concepts for the algorithm development.
- From_scratch_logistic_regression: As mentioned above, using matrix multiplication I have implemented logistic regression from scratch.
- Ensemble.RMD: R markdown file comparing the three algorithms: decision trees, bagging and boosting techniques using the trees package.
