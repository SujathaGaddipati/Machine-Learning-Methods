# Machine-Learning
## Introduction
I have created this repository to include all my R programming files and python juypter notebooks that include my learnings on machine learning.  
- From_Scratch_Linear_regression: I have done Python coding for linear regression without implementing any ML packages. It follows matrix multiplication concepts for the algorithm development.
- From_scratch_logistic_regression: As mentioned above, using matrix multiplication I have implemented logistic regression from scratch.
Ensemble.RMD: RMD file in R for using decision trees and bagging and boosting techniques using the trees package.
