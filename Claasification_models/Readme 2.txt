## Readme file for classification_model folder

### The enclosed assignment includes:    
- GPU_data-KNN_ANN.py
- Spambase_data_KNN_ANN.py
- SVM_DT_Boosting.ipynb

### GPU_data-KNN_ANN.py
- This is the python file that consists of the complete code for implementing the classification algorithms on the GPU data. It's a python code, which can be opened via pycharm. Load the data files with the appropriate directory path to run the code

### Spambase_data_KNN_ANN.py
- This is the python file that consists of the complete code for implementing the classification algorithms on the sambas data. It's a python code, which can be opened via pycharm. Load the data files with the appropriate directory path to run the code

- The code follows the following outline  
    *Data loading and preparation for both the datasets  
    *ANN and KNN experiments 
    
### Spambase dataset
- It is the spamdata.csv file for my 2nd dataset choice
